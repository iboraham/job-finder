6,Turkish Language Talent Programme,Birmingham,Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ),,"If you’re studying for a degree in Turkish, GCHQ and MI5 two of the UK’s intelligence agencies, are offering you an exciting opportunity to join their Language Talent Programme.

THE ROLE

GCHQ & MI5 employ highly skilled Language Analysts in a variety of exciting and rewarding roles. The Language Talent Programme is an 11-week paid scheme for language interns at either GCHQ’s headquarters in Cheltenham (Mandarin, Turkish and Persian) or MI5’s headquarters in London (Mandarin only). Regardless of agency or location, you’ll be a fully integrated member of an analysis team, using your language skills to contribute directly to our work and really make a difference.

Your language skills and cultural knowledge will be central to all the work you do while on your placement with us. The precise nature of the role will depend on the agency, but you’ll work on a project which could involve analysing, transcribing and translating audio or textual material (which may be technical or specialist in nature), assessing data for intelligence value using bespoke analytical tools and techniques, drafting intelligence reports, conducting research using a variety of tools, providing investigators and agent handlers with contextual cultural knowledge, delivering briefings to the team and liaising with customers and partners. Your skills will have a genuine impact on the team’s work and help enable the team and organisation to fulfill its goals.

At the end of the scheme, you’ll have the opportunity to sit the graduate-entry language and analysis tests. If you pass these tests and a competency interview, we’ll offer you a permanent position as a Language Analyst, subject to there being vacancies at that time.

REQUIREMENTS

We’re looking for talented, flexible and committed individuals from all backgrounds. You’ll currently be an undergraduate in your final year of studying Turkish. Ideally, you’ll have completed your year abroad (where possible; we understand COVID-19 may have curtailed this) and have, or be on course to develop, the high-level language skills we need. You’ll have an interest in using your language in your career and be keen to develop your skills. For roles at GCHQ, although you may not already have a technical background, you’ll be open to learning new technical skills to complement your language ability.

GCHQ & MI5 can offer long and rewarding careers which combine these language, technical and analytical skills, and we’re looking to select participants for this programme who have an aspiration to work with us long term.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

GCHQ and MI5 have an inclusive and supportive working environment that’s designed to encourage open minds and attitudes. We value and nurture talent and are committed to helping you fulfill your potential. You’ll receive a comprehensive training and development package in both language and analysis that will include classroom-based learning and hands-on training, which will enable you to grow your skills and perform to the best of your abilities.

Throughout your internship and career, you’ll be supported by trained professionals and language mentors within our collaborative learning environment. You’ll have genuine responsibility from an early stage while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

ABOUT GCHQ

GCHQ works to keep the UK safe and secure in the challenging environment of modern communications. The online threats that the UK faces every day are many and varied, and cyber criminals, terrorists, hackers, fraudsters and organised criminal gangs are all using ever more sophisticated technology. These threats to UK national security come in a multitude of different languages and GCHQ’s Language Analysts use their expert language skills to piece together snippets of information gathered from a variety of digital communications sources.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES STATEMENT

GCHQ and MI5 are Disability Confident and Equal Opportunities employers, committed to reflecting the society we protect. Our recruitment process is fair, transparent and based on merit. We particularly welcome applications from diverse and under-represented groups.

SALARY

While on the Language Talent Programme, you will receive a salary of £25,040 per annum at GCHQ, pro-rata over 11 weeks (includes a concessionary payment).

Applicants who pass the end-of-programme graduate-entry language and analysis tests and assessment centre, and who are made and accept an offer of employment at GCHQ, will receive a starting salary of £30,831 (includes a concessionary payment). This would rise to £33,831 upon successful completion of your 6-month probation period.

LOCATION

The placements will be in Cheltenham.

SELECTION PROCESS

To be eligible to apply for this position you must meet our nationality, residency and security requirements. Full details of these requirements can be found on the GCHQ and MI5 Recruitment websites.

Be prepared to dedicate 60-90 minutes towards completing this application. We’re conscious this might be more time than you expected, so our system will allow you to save your application at any time and come back to it later. But remember to submit your full application before the closing date of 19 October 2020.

If you meet the minimum eligibility and application sift criteria, the next steps of this selection process will be:

First stage - Language tests and drug test (will be held week commencing 9 November 2020*)
Second stage - Assessment centre, comprising an interview and a preliminary vetting chat (will be held week commencing 30 November 2020*)

We are planning our recruitment activity in uncertain and quickly changing times. We reserve the right to postpone these dates due to the ongoing situation with Covid-19.

Face-to-face language testing (with social-distancing in a COVID-secure environment) will be held in Gloucestershire (and potentially London) with the second stage of assessment taking place virtually.

If you are successful in the selection process, you’ll receive a job offer, conditional upon you completing our developed vetting (DV) process that enables you to obtain the level of security clearance required to undertake this role.

Please be aware that we withhold the right to bring forward the closing date for this role from the original closing date once a certain number of applications have been received. Please be mindful of this and submit your application at your earliest convenience to avoid disappointment."

THE ROLE

GCHQ and MI5 employ highly skilled Language Analysts in a variety of exciting and rewarding roles.

You’ll have an interest in using your language in your career and be keen to develop your skills. For roles at GCHQ, although you may not already have a technical background, you’ll be open to learning new technical skills to complement your language ability.

26,Persian Language Talent Programme,Birmingham,Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ),,"If you’re studying for a degree in Persian, GCHQ and MI5 two of the UK’s intelligence agencies, are offering you an exciting opportunity to join their Language Talent Programme.

THE ROLE

GCHQ and MI5 employ highly skilled Language Analysts in a variety of exciting and rewarding roles. The Language Talent Programme is an 11-week paid scheme for language interns at either GCHQ’s headquarters in Cheltenham (Mandarin, Turkish and Persian) or MI5’s headquarters in London (Mandarin only). Regardless of agency or location, you’ll be a fully integrated member of an analysis team, using your language skills to contribute directly to our work and really make a difference.

Your language skills and cultural knowledge will be central to all the work you do while on your placement with us. The precise nature of the role will depend on the agency, but you’ll work on a project which could involve analysing, transcribing and translating audio or textual material (which may be technical or specialist in nature), assessing data for intelligence value using bespoke analytical tools and techniques, drafting intelligence reports, conducting research using a variety of tools, providing investigators and agent handlers with contextual cultural knowledge, delivering briefings to the team and liaising with customers and partners. Your skills will have a genuine impact on the team’s work and help enable the team and organisation to fulfill its goals.

At the end of the scheme, you’ll have the opportunity to sit the graduate-entry language and analysis tests. If you pass these tests and a competency interview, we’ll offer you a permanent position as a Language Analyst, subject to there being vacancies at that time.

REQUIREMENTS

We’re looking for talented, flexible and committed individuals from all backgrounds. You’ll currently be an undergraduate in your final year of studying Persian. Ideally, you’ll have completed your year abroad (where possible; we understand COVID-19 may have curtailed this) and have, or be on course to develop, the high-level language skills we need. You’ll have an interest in using your language in your career and be keen to develop your skills. For roles at GCHQ, although you may not already have a technical background, you’ll be open to learning new technical skills to complement your language ability.

GCHQ and MI5 can offer long and rewarding careers which combine these language, technical and analytical skills, and we’re looking to select participants for this programme who have an aspiration to work with us long term.

TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT

GCHQ and MI5 have an inclusive and supportive working environment that’s designed to encourage open minds and attitudes. We value and nurture talent and are committed to helping you fulfill your potential. You’ll receive a comprehensive training and development package in both language and analysis that will include classroom-based learning and hands-on training, which will enable you to grow your skills and perform to the best of your abilities.

Throughout your internship and career, you’ll be supported by trained professionals and language mentors within our collaborative learning environment. You’ll have genuine responsibility from an early stage while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

ABOUT GCHQ

GCHQ works to keep the UK safe and secure in the challenging environment of modern communications. The online threats that the UK faces every day are many and varied, and cyber criminals, terrorists, hackers, fraudsters and organised criminal gangs are all using ever more sophisticated technology. These threats to UK national security come in a multitude of different languages and GCHQ’s Language Analysts use their expert language skills to piece together snippets of information gathered from a variety of digital communications sources.

EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES STATEMENT

GCHQ and MI5 are Disability Confident and Equal Opportunities employers, committed to reflecting the society we protect. Our recruitment process is fair, transparent and based on merit. We particularly welcome applications from diverse and under-represented groups.

SALARY

While on the Language Talent Programme, you will receive a salary of £25,040 per annum at GCHQ, pro-rata over 11 weeks (includes a concessionary payment).

Applicants who pass the end-of-programme graduate-entry language and analysis tests and assessment centre, and who are made and accept an offer of employment at GCHQ, will receive a starting salary of £30,831 (includes a concessionary payment). This would rise to £33,831 upon successful completion of your 6-month probation period.
LOCATION

The placements will be in Cheltenham.

To be eligible to apply for this position you must meet our nationality, residency and security requirements. Full details of these requirements can be found on the GCHQ and MI5 Recruitment websites.

Walthamstow Academy opened its impressive new building in 2006 and since then we have achieved excellent results both at GCSE and at A Level. In 2019, Walthamstow Academy students achieved a Progress 8 score of 0.4). At A-Level, our students achieve excellently with many of them progressing to Russell Group institutions. Because we are so successful, the school is now full and oversubscribed on first choices alone.

We do not achieve these results by accident. At Walthamstow Academy, we believe in the best in everyone. We have a relentless focus on high expectations and aim to identify barriers to success and provide necessary support as quickly as possible to ensure our students achieve. We do not accept excuses and always strive for the best.

The Academy is proud of its multi-cultural character and we celebrate the diversity of heritage in our community. 84% of our students are from minority ethnic groups, many coming from African, Caribbean, Eastern European, Turkish and Pakistani communities.

Within the community served by the academy there is social and economic disadvantage with more than half of the students being eligible for Pupil Premium. One third of the students have a first language other than English and a significant number have low levels of literacy on entry. Many students enter the Academy with low levels of attainment and the staff work hard to add value to their performance. Standards across the Academy are above national averages in most subjects.

The Academy is located close to the North Circular Road, M11 and both Blackhorse Road and Walthamstow Central underground stations from where it takes about half an hour to get into central London. The Academy is situated in a part of London where property prices are still relatively inexpensive and within easy access of Epping Forest, the Lee Valley and rural Hertfordshire and Essex.

87,Director - Open Banking Product Management (Regional),London,MasterCard,,"Open Banking is a worldwide phenomenon, gathering pace over the recent years and set to transform many aspects of retail financial services (as well as many adjacent industries). There are a number of markets already live with various forms of open banking offerings (e.g. EEA markets thanks to PSD2, or US owing to long-standing market driven initiatives). In most other markets, open banking is at earlier stages of development, yet already seeing plenty of attention from established players as well as new entrants.

Mastercard have built an initial suite of Open Banking Solutions and are now in the process of bringing them to market, commercialising and enhancing them, predominantly to date in Europe. See www.mastercard.com/openbanking. Over the last few years we have established a large, cross-functional team that is focusing on product design and delivery.

This new role is pivotal in enabling Mastercard to establish open banking presence outside of the EEA. Key aspects of the role:
(1) designing and executing the appropriate strategy for establishing open banking connectivity in key markets within the region; and
(2) driving the localisation and deployment of selected global Mastercard Open Banking Solutions in key markets within the region.

In the process, the individual will work closely with, and where appropriate influence/persuade:
Regional O&T technical experts focusing on scoping the technology aspect of the open banking rollout
Regional IMK business development function, to build understanding of the needs of local key customers (banks as well as fintechs, merchants and others), as well as to commence early stage deployment conversations
Regional Corporate Development and Procurement personnel if the local deployment requires use of external supplier(s)
Regional Data & Strategy leads, to jointly drive the data requirements behind local products and services
The central O&T teams that will drive product localisation, as well as Regional Customer Delivery and Legal on setting up new relevant onboarding processes and contracts

The individual will be an expert on the relevant features, benefits, and the needs of current and future customers. The individual will also be a key member of the Mastercard Open Banking Global Product team responsible for defining and executing the product strategy for the overall product portfolio.

Role is expected to require some travel to customer engagements, events etc. (<30%)

You will:

Design optimal strategy for product deployment and localisation across the key markets within the region, factoring in the current and projected future state of the relevant markets, competitors, regulatory pressures etc. Accompanying that, you will develop and maintain cost forecasts behind connectivity build, as well as costs, revenue and sales forecasts behind localised Open Banking Solutions with Sales, O&T and Finance that stand the test of time.
Work with third party companies throughout the sourcing, contracting and deployment phase to drive regional execution of our strategy
Actively engage potential customers and partners within the region, and drive the process of reflecting their needs in the local deployment of the relevant open banking products
Be a regional internal expert on open banking as a whole, staying engaged with key ongoing market developments, regulatory interventions, competitor activity, events and conferences etc.
Act as “Regional Product Owner” through the development life-cycle working as an integrated part of the delivery team utilising agile development techniques. In some circumstances it will be in the context of Mastercard internal teams, in others with third party suppliers / partner. You will actively translate specifics of the local market (e.g. data protection, data privacy, on-soil requirements etc.) to product requirements, feed them into relevant product localisation planning
While the role commences as a ‘individual contributor’, the individual is expected to over time be involved in growing the regional product footprint of open banking resources, with significant potential for moving to a position of managing other people within ~6-12 months. In this regard, the role will be responsible also for training and up-skilling any new team members.

114,Director - Open Banking Product Management (Regional),London,MasterCard,,"Open Banking is a worldwide phenomenon, gathering pace over the recent years and set to transform many aspects of retail financial services (as well as many adjacent industries). There are a number of markets already live with various forms of open banking offerings (e.g. EEA markets thanks to PSD2, or US owing to long-standing market driven initiatives). In most other markets, open banking is at earlier stages of development, yet already seeing plenty of attention from established players as well as new entrants.

Mastercard have built an initial suite of Open Banking Solutions and are now in the process of bringing them to market, commercialising and enhancing them, predominantly to date in Europe. See www.mastercard.com/openbanking. Over the last few years we have established a large, cross-functional team that is focusing on product design and delivery.

This new role is pivotal in enabling Mastercard to establish open banking presence outside of the EEA. Key aspects of the role:
(1) designing and executing the appropriate strategy for establishing open banking connectivity in key markets within the region; and
(2) driving the localisation and deployment of selected global Mastercard Open Banking Solutions in key markets within the region.

In the process, the individual will work closely with, and where appropriate influence/persuade:
Regional O&T technical experts focusing on scoping the technology aspect of the open banking rollout
Regional IMK business development function, to build understanding of the needs of local key customers (banks as well as fintechs, merchants and others), as well as to commence early stage deployment conversations
Regional Corporate Development and Procurement personnel if the local deployment requires use of external supplier(s)
Regional Data & Strategy leads, to jointly drive the data requirements behind local products and services
The central O&T teams that will drive product localisation, as well as Regional Customer Delivery and Legal on setting up new relevant onboarding processes and contracts

The individual will be an expert on the relevant features, benefits, and the needs of current and future customers. The individual will also be a key member of the Mastercard Open Banking Global Product team responsible for defining and executing the product strategy for the overall product portfolio.

Role is expected to require some travel to customer engagements, events etc. (<30%)

You will:

Design optimal strategy for product deployment and localisation across the key markets within the region, factoring in the current and projected future state of the relevant markets, competitors, regulatory pressures etc. Accompanying that, you will develop and maintain cost forecasts behind connectivity build, as well as costs, revenue and sales forecasts behind localised Open Banking Solutions with Sales, O&T and Finance that stand the test of time.
Work with third party companies throughout the sourcing, contracting and deployment phase to drive regional execution of our strategy
Actively engage potential customers and partners within the region, and drive the process of reflecting their needs in the local deployment of the relevant open banking products
Be a regional internal expert on open banking as a whole, staying engaged with key ongoing market developments, regulatory interventions, competitor activity, events and conferences etc.
Act as “Regional Product Owner” through the development life-cycle working as an integrated part of the delivery team utilising agile development techniques. In some circumstances it will be in the context of Mastercard internal teams, in others with third party suppliers / partner. You will actively translate specifics of the local market (e.g. data protection, data privacy, on-soil requirements etc.) to product requirements, feed them into relevant product localisation planning
While the role commences as a ‘individual contributor’, the individual is expected to over time be involved in growing the regional product footprint of open banking resources, with significant potential for moving to a position of managing other people within ~6-12 months. In this regard, the role will be responsible also for training and up-skilling any new team members.




All About You

Skills and experience required for this role are:
Experience of banking, payments or FinTech sectors.

144,Director - Open Banking Product Management (Regional),London,MasterCard,,"Open Banking is a worldwide phenomenon, gathering pace over the recent years and set to transform many aspects of retail financial services (as well as many adjacent industries). There are a number of markets already live with various forms of open banking offerings (e.g. EEA markets thanks to PSD2, or US owing to long-standing market driven initiatives). In most other markets, open banking is at earlier stages of development, yet already seeing plenty of attention from established players as well as new entrants.

Mastercard have built an initial suite of Open Banking Solutions and are now in the process of bringing them to market, commercialising and enhancing them, predominantly to date in Europe. See www.mastercard.com/openbanking. Over the last few years we have established a large, cross-functional team that is focusing on product design and delivery.

This new role is pivotal in enabling Mastercard to establish open banking presence outside of the EEA. Key aspects of the role:
(1) designing and executing the appropriate strategy for establishing open banking connectivity in key markets within the region; and
(2) driving the localisation and deployment of selected global Mastercard Open Banking Solutions in key markets within the region.

In the process, the individual will work closely with, and where appropriate influence/persuade:
Regional O&T technical experts focusing on scoping the technology aspect of the open banking rollout
Regional IMK business development function, to build understanding of the needs of local key customers (banks as well as fintechs, merchants and others), as well as to commence early stage deployment conversations
Regional Corporate Development and Procurement personnel if the local deployment requires use of external supplier(s)
Regional Data & Strategy leads, to jointly drive the data requirements behind local products and services
The central O&T teams that will drive product localisation, as well as Regional Customer Delivery and Legal on setting up new relevant onboarding processes and contracts

The individual will be an expert on the relevant features, benefits, and the needs of current and future customers. The individual will also be a key member of the Mastercard Open Banking Global Product team responsible for defining and executing the product strategy for the overall product portfolio.

Role is expected to require some travel to customer engagements, events etc. (<30%)

You will:

Design optimal strategy for product deployment and localisation across the key markets within the region, factoring in the current and projected future state of the relevant markets, competitors, regulatory pressures etc. Accompanying that, you will develop and maintain cost forecasts behind connectivity build, as well as costs, revenue and sales forecasts behind localised Open Banking Solutions with Sales, O&T and Finance that stand the test of time.
Work with third party companies throughout the sourcing, contracting and deployment phase to drive regional execution of our strategy
Actively engage potential customers and partners within the region, and drive the process of reflecting their needs in the local deployment of the relevant open banking products
Be a regional internal expert on open banking as a whole, staying engaged with key ongoing market developments, regulatory interventions, competitor activity, events and conferences etc.
Act as “Regional Product Owner” through the development life-cycle working as an integrated part of the delivery team utilising agile development techniques. In some circumstances it will be in the context of Mastercard internal teams, in others with third party suppliers / partner. You will actively translate specifics of the local market (e.g. data protection, data privacy, on-soil requirements etc.) to product requirements, feed them into relevant product localisation planning
While the role commences as a ‘individual contributor’, the individual is expected to over time be involved in growing the regional product footprint of open banking resources, with significant potential for moving to a position of managing other people within ~6-12 months. In this regard, the role will be responsible also for training and up-skilling any new team members.

Empowering customers to live rewarding and happy lives. That’s when it hits home!
At Home Group it’s critical we continue to deliver services for our customers during the COVID-19 outbreak, and our awesome colleagues are at the very heart of making that happen. We are doing things a little differently at the moment, so to keep you, our customers and ourselves safe we’ll engage with you digitally.
We have a brilliant opportunity for you to join our independent supported living CQC service in the beautiful old mill town of Kirklees. Our Queen Street service supports adult customers who have complex needs including Learning Disabilities, Personality Disorders and Mental Health diagnosis. We offer person centred support, helping customers to live in their own home and fulfil their goals and aspirations so they can live their best lives.
Our beautifully refurbished property at Queen Street in Ravensthorpe, has self-contained furnished apartments, with two buildings with open living spaces and a newly decked outside area (ideal for those summer BBQ’s). We are also very close to Huddersfield town centre by public transport or by car.
Your role
You’ll be a lone worker during the night and our customers’ first point of call if they need you. Working waking nights as our Supported Living Worker, you’ll be supporting our customers to live their day to day lives as independently as possible, helping with everyday activities including daily living tasks, health, emotional and behavioural support. You’ll be helping customers who have more complex needs with personal care, such as bathing in the evening and issuing medication. You’ll be our night owl who safeguards our customers and our building, ensures records are kept up to date and ready to handover to day shift colleagues. You might even carry out some light cleaning duties if needed.
About our team
Tracey is our Registered Manager at the service who has worked at Home Group for over 17 years in lots of our different services, so you’ll have tons of experienced support on hand. Tracey has a fab sense of humour and a very supportive nature and loves nothing more than relaxing with a good crime novel, psychological drama or walking her dog Dink! Tracey also has an adventurous side! She enjoys nothing more than snorkelling off the Turkish coast or quad biking through the mountains!
You’ll be reporting to Sophie our Deputy Manager, a busy super mum of 2. In her spare time (when she gets it) she likes to catch up with friends over a nice meal or relaxing watching a TV thriller.
We are a diverse, expanding team made up of a Registered Manager, Deputy Manager, Support Coordinators, Night Support Workers and Support Workers! We don’t just love to support our customers, we’re there for each other too!
Working hours
These waking night roles will cover the twilight shifts and the shift patterns available are:
Week 1 – Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday (waking nights 8.45 pm to 8.15 am)
Week 2 – Thursday (waking night 8.45 pm to 8.15 am) Saturday & Sunday (all-day 8am-9pm)
Or weekends only (Fri, Sat, Sun waking nights)
We need you to be flexible to meet the needs of our customers, but we’ll also give you the time you need to spend time doing the things that matter to you!
Bank
Looking for a more flexible working pattern? You can also join us on a flexible basis by being part of our bank. You can work hours that fit around your current commitments or even pick up some additional shifts to your main role to earn some extra cash and get paid on a weekly basis.
About you
You’ll have a positive can do attitude and passionate about making a big impact on our customers’ lives. It would be amazing if you have worked in this type of environment before, however it’s your “can do” positive attitude and enthusiasm that are critical to make this role a success. We can nurture your talent, just let us know in your cover letter why you have a passion for working here! Don’t worry, we won’t drop you in the deep end, we’ll nurture your talent, help you understand how things work at Home Group and you’ll have a fantastic induction with ongoing learning and support!
You’ll ideally hold a Level 2 certificate or equivalent in Health and Social Care, if you don’t, we’ll pay and support you to achieve this. If you’re not the biggest fan of technology, that’s not a problem to us. You do need to know that we are quite a high tech company and most of our application process and mandatory learning are online. However we’re glad to support you, if you need help.
When you join, you’ll need to have a valid Enhanced Check under the Disclosure and Barring Service. The great news is that we will pay for that to be done if you don’t have a transferrable one.

174,Director - Open Banking Product Management (Regional),London,MasterCard,,"Open Banking is a worldwide phenomenon, gathering pace over the recent years and set to transform many aspects of retail financial services (as well as many adjacent industries). There are a number of markets already live with various forms of open banking offerings (e.g. EEA markets thanks to PSD2, or US owing to long-standing market driven initiatives). In most other markets, open banking is at earlier stages of development, yet already seeing plenty of attention from established players as well as new entrants.

Mastercard have built an initial suite of Open Banking Solutions and are now in the process of bringing them to market, commercialising and enhancing them, predominantly to date in Europe. See www.mastercard.com/openbanking. Over the last few years we have established a large, cross-functional team that is focusing on product design and delivery.

This new role is pivotal in enabling Mastercard to establish open banking presence outside of the EEA. Key aspects of the role:
(1) designing and executing the appropriate strategy for establishing open banking connectivity in key markets within the region; and
(2) driving the localisation and deployment of selected global Mastercard Open Banking Solutions in key markets within the region.

In the process, the individual will work closely with, and where appropriate influence/persuade:
Regional O&T technical experts focusing on scoping the technology aspect of the open banking rollout
Regional IMK business development function, to build understanding of the needs of local key customers (banks as well as fintechs, merchants and others), as well as to commence early stage deployment conversations
Regional Corporate Development and Procurement personnel if the local deployment requires use of external supplier(s)
Regional Data & Strategy leads, to jointly drive the data requirements behind local products and services
The central O&T teams that will drive product localisation, as well as Regional Customer Delivery and Legal on setting up new relevant onboarding processes and contracts

The individual will be an expert on the relevant features, benefits, and the needs of current and future customers. The individual will also be a key member of the Mastercard Open Banking Global Product team responsible for defining and executing the product strategy for the overall product portfolio.

Role is expected to require some travel to customer engagements, events etc. (<30%)

You will:

Design optimal strategy for product deployment and localisation across the key markets within the region, factoring in the current and projected future state of the relevant markets, competitors, regulatory pressures etc. Accompanying that, you will develop and maintain cost forecasts behind connectivity build, as well as costs, revenue and sales forecasts behind localised Open Banking Solutions with Sales, O&T and Finance that stand the test of time.
Work with third party companies throughout the sourcing, contracting and deployment phase to drive regional execution of our strategy
Actively engage potential customers and partners within the region, and drive the process of reflecting their needs in the local deployment of the relevant open banking products
Be a regional internal expert on open banking as a whole, staying engaged with key ongoing market developments, regulatory interventions, competitor activity, events and conferences etc.
Act as “Regional Product Owner” through the development life-cycle working as an integrated part of the delivery team utilising agile development techniques. In some circumstances it will be in the context of Mastercard internal teams, in others with third party suppliers / partner. You will actively translate specifics of the local market (e.g. data protection, data privacy, on-soil requirements etc.) to product requirements, feed them into relevant product localisation planning
While the role commences as a ‘individual contributor’, the individual is expected to over time be involved in growing the regional product footprint of open banking resources, with significant potential for moving to a position of managing other people within ~6-12 months. In this regard, the role will be responsible also for training and up-skilling any new team members.

203,Director - Open Banking Product Management (Regional),London,MasterCard,,"Open Banking is a worldwide phenomenon, gathering pace over the recent years and set to transform many aspects of retail financial services (as well as many adjacent industries). There are a number of markets already live with various forms of open banking offerings (e.g. EEA markets thanks to PSD2, or US owing to long-standing market driven initiatives). In most other markets, open banking is at earlier stages of development, yet already seeing plenty of attention from established players as well as new entrants.

Mastercard have built an initial suite of Open Banking Solutions and are now in the process of bringing them to market, commercialising and enhancing them, predominantly to date in Europe. See www.mastercard.com/openbanking. Over the last few years we have established a large, cross-functional team that is focusing on product design and delivery.

This new role is pivotal in enabling Mastercard to establish open banking presence outside of the EEA. Key aspects of the role:
(1) designing and executing the appropriate strategy for establishing open banking connectivity in key markets within the region; and
(2) driving the localisation and deployment of selected global Mastercard Open Banking Solutions in key markets within the region.

In the process, the individual will work closely with, and where appropriate influence/persuade:
Regional O&T technical experts focusing on scoping the technology aspect of the open banking rollout
Regional IMK business development function, to build understanding of the needs of local key customers (banks as well as fintechs, merchants and others), as well as to commence early stage deployment conversations
Regional Corporate Development and Procurement personnel if the local deployment requires use of external supplier(s)
Regional Data & Strategy leads, to jointly drive the data requirements behind local products and services
The central O&T teams that will drive product localisation, as well as Regional Customer Delivery and Legal on setting up new relevant onboarding processes and contracts

The individual will be an expert on the relevant features, benefits, and the needs of current and future customers. The individual will also be a key member of the Mastercard Open Banking Global Product team responsible for defining and executing the product strategy for the overall product portfolio.

Role is expected to require some travel to customer engagements, events etc. (<30%)

You will:

Design optimal strategy for product deployment and localisation across the key markets within the region, factoring in the current and projected future state of the relevant markets, competitors, regulatory pressures etc. Accompanying that, you will develop and maintain cost forecasts behind connectivity build, as well as costs, revenue and sales forecasts behind localised Open Banking Solutions with Sales, O&T and Finance that stand the test of time.
Work with third party companies throughout the sourcing, contracting and deployment phase to drive regional execution of our strategy
Actively engage potential customers and partners within the region, and drive the process of reflecting their needs in the local deployment of the relevant open banking products
Be a regional internal expert on open banking as a whole, staying engaged with key ongoing market developments, regulatory interventions, competitor activity, events and conferences etc.
Act as “Regional Product Owner” through the development life-cycle working as an integrated part of the delivery team utilising agile development techniques. In some circumstances it will be in the context of Mastercard internal teams, in others with third party suppliers / partner. You will actively translate specifics of the local market (e.g. data protection, data privacy, on-soil requirements etc.) to product requirements, feed them into relevant product localisation planning
While the role commences as a ‘individual contributor’, the individual is expected to over time be involved in growing the regional product footprint of open banking resources, with significant potential for moving to a position of managing other people within ~6-12 months. In this regard, the role will be responsible also for training and up-skilling any new team members.
